----------------------------------FRONTEND RULES----------------------------------
Always use tailwind to style if the codebase is using it. Always use functional react. 
Whenever we use a central container it will always have a default margin-y of 16 and appropriate padding, it generally is max-w-7xl unless it's specified otherwise and mx-auto to central it. Here's an example:
<section className="my-16 px-4">
	<div className="mx-auto max-w-7xl>
	…
	</div>
</section>
If something has a background we typically display it like this and break pattern when it's a page builder block. Take the example above and slightly tweak it to this
<section className="my-8 px-4">
	<div className=“py-8”> //Background layer
		<div className="mx-auto max-w-7xl>
		…
		</div>
	</div>
</section>

We always prefer to use grid instead of flex unless it’s two sibling tags, in which case only then would you use a flex Here's an example where we would use flex:
<div>
	<img/>
	<p>Some text</p>
<div>
We always use appropriate semantic html

----------------------------------REFACTORING RULES----------------------------------
Any time you refactor to tailwind, if there's any form of logic with styles, make sure you use the cn utility otherwise it won't work
Any time there's a charka ui heading without styles, it's the equivalent of a text-4xl by default
